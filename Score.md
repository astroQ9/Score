## Score
### Regression
The score method in many machine learning libraries typically returns different metrics depending on the type of model you're using.
For some models, like regression models, it might return the R-squared value, which is a measure of how well the independent variables explain the variance in the dependent variable.

### Classification
However, for classification models like the Support Vector Classifier (svc_Classifier), the score method usually returns accuracy, which measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
